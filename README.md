# PyTorch Demo of the Hyperspectral Image Classification method - SSFTT.

Using the code should cite the following papers:

1. L. Sun, G. Zhao, Y. Zheng, Z. Wu. Spectral–spatial feature tokenization transformer for hyperspectral image classification. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing. 2022.
2. L. Sun, C. Ma, Y. Chen .  Low rank component induced spatial-spectral kernel method for hyperspectral image classification. IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology. 2020.
